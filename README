Changes all the text colour in an ebook to black on white. It annoys me when some e-books have grey text web2.0 style.  It's just wrong I don't care how trendy some hipster author feels about it.  Fuck 'em!

If you're feeling brave run this in the root of your Calibre directory with:

find. -name \*.epub -exec book2black.py {} \;

After doing a backup of course.
